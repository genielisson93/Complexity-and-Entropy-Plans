# Complexity-and-Entropy-Plans

Here are the data to generate the complexity-entropy planes for the Shannon, Tsallis, and RÃ©nyi entropies. They include the Python codes and the probability distribution tables for 50 samples of the six coronavirus species (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63), both for full sequences and Spike proteins.
